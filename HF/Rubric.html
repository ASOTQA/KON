											<u>2020-01-31</u>
											<ul>
												<li><span class="update-element">Teacher Output:</span> Frequency scoring guides have been changed to reflect the feedback regarding prior overlap. The teacher output category has also been given extra explanation of how to better assign proportion to appropriate output.</li>
												<li><Span class="update-element">Instruction Giving and Explanations:</Span> A new emphasisis on guidance given to students has been added to all descriptors, whilst appropriateness has been removed due to the clear overlap with Teacher Output. Instructions/Explanations should be asessed by a teacher's attempt to supplement an instruction/explanation where necessary. For example, to model, repeat, or rephrase if the delivery was initially unclear. Please note: This change grants teachers a degree of freedom in the types of guidance they provide.</li>
												<li>New benchmark clips added</li>
											</ul>
											<u>2020-01-17</u>
											<ul>
												<li><span class="update-element">Classroom Tools:</span> Developing descriptor - little variety (no more than two tools/tool uses) has been better defined in contrast with variety (more than two tools/tool uses)</li>
												<li><span class="update-element">Instruction Giving and Explanations:</span> Needs Improvement descriptor - Threshold has been raised to 'Three or more instances of unclear explanation'. This was previously only requiring two.</li>
												<li><span class="update-element">Lesson Delivery:</span> Multiple descriptors - the words 'fun' have been removed from this element. The descision was taken to remove this subjective wording and replace it with engagement/engaging. This is also in order to capture genuine creative efforts that are lesson-specific though not necessarily 'fun'.</li>
												<li><span class="update-element">Lesson Delivery:</span> Meets Expectations descriptor - 'engaging techniques' has now been better defined.</li>

												Immediate intervention might not always be obvious, but please use your best judgement. Generally, anything that is either inappropriate between a teacher and a student OR any external variable that significantly impedes learning should be classified as immediate intervention. Some examples (though not exhaustive) can include:
												<ul>
													<li>teacher eating or drinking</li>
													<li>unprofessional online environment</li>
													<li>teacher laying down</li>
													<li>posters in the background with non-child-friendly content</li>
													<li>constant movement of the camera</li>
													<li>messy background containing lots of boxes, books, clutter, etc.</li>
													<li>rude behavior</li>
													<li>using curse words</li>
													<li>yawning excessively</li>
													<li>scolding / raising their voice at the student or parent</li>
													<li>lewd behavior or images</li>
													<li>unprofessional clothing (e.g., strapless top, no clothing, inappropriate images or wording displayed)</li>
												</ul>
												If you're unsure whether behavior that you have observed should be flagged, feel free to ask for assistance from ASOT or more experienced mentors in the Team's channel.
