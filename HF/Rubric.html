                                                        Immediate intervention might not always be obvious, but please use your best judgement. Generally, anything that is either innappropriate between a teacher and a student OR any external variable that significantly impedes learning should be classified as immediate intervention. Some examples (though not exhaustive) can include:

                                                        </ul>
